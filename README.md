# ImpressionsDemoWebpage

This is a demo site which I have made with the help of HTML and CSS. Perhaps I can be more creative like changing wallpapers or fonts, but I think if I work in a team I can take different viewpoints and experience of each member which will result in better creativity.

Thank you for giving me this task as it helped me understand the basics of CSS.
